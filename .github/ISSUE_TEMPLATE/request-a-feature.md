If you have a feature suggestion for Multiverse-Core, read the following tips:

1.  Fill out the template.
      This will help us understand what you're requesting and why you want us
      to add it.

2.  Keep it simple.
      Make sure it's easy to understand what you're requesting. A good way is
      to keep it to one request per GitHub issue, as we can then easily track
      feature requests.

3.  Check whether it has already been asked or added.
      You can search the issue tracker to see if your feature has already been
      requested at https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/issues.

4.  Ask yourself: "Does this belong in Multiverse-Core?"
      There are lots of features that we reject because most servers won't
      need or use them. If your feature is very specific or already exists in
      another plugin, it might not be a good fit for Multiverse-Core.

5.  Delete this line and all above lines before posting your issue!       -->
