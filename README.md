# About

[Multiverse](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-core) was created at the dawn of Bukkit multiworld support. It has since then grown into a **complete world management solution!** Multiverse provides the easiest to use world management solution for your Minecraft server, big or small, and with great addons like [Portals](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-portals) and [NetherPortals](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/multiverse-netherportals/), what's not to love!

Now it's time to create your very own Multiverse server, do check out our [Wiki](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki) and [Usage Guide](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Core/wiki/Basics) to get started. Feel free to hop onto our [Discord](https://discord.gg/NZtfKky) if you have any question or just want to have a chat with us!

## Amazing sub-modules available:

* [Multiverse-NetherPortals](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-NetherPortals) -> Have separate nether and end worlds for each of your overworlds!
* [Multiverse-Portals](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Portals) -> Make custom portals to go to any destination!
* [Multiverse-Inventories](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-Inventories) -> Have separated players stats and inventories per world or per group of worlds.
* [Multiverse-SignPortals](https://github.com/Multiverse/Multiverse-SignPortals) -> Signs as teleporters!
